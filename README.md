# Reservation Cancellation Prediction
This mini project focuses on solving a classification problem: predicting whether a customer will cancel the reservation they have made at a hotel. The dataset used for this project is the [Reservation Cancellation Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravduttakiit/reservation-cancellation-prediction?select=train__dataset.csv), which consists of approximately 18,000 examples and 18 features, including the target variable. The goal is to estimate whether a person will cancel their booking, with the cancellation status labeled as `booking_status` in the dataset (1 = canceled).

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about hotel bookings, including various features such as the number of adults and children, the number of week and weekend nights, the type of meal plan, room type, and lead time. The dataset offers a diverse set of features that can be utilized to build predictive models. With over 18,000 observations, the dataset provides a substantial sample size for analysis.

It is important to note that the dataset may have some challenges that could impact the accuracy of the models and mislead the results. These challenges include:

- **Class Imbalance**: The target variable, `booking_status`, may have an imbalance between the cancellation and non-cancellation classes. This imbalance could influence the model's performance and necessitate appropriate techniques to handle it.

- **Missing Values**: The dataset might contain missing values in some features. Addressing missing data is crucial to avoid biased results and improve model performance.

- **Feature Correlation**: There may be features that have stronger correlations with the target class or with each other. Identifying and considering these relationships can help enhance the model's accuracy and interpretability.

## Approach and Improvements
To improve the performance of the Reservation Cancellation Prediction model, several steps were taken:

- **Feature Engineering**: Additional features were created or transformed to capture more meaningful information from the data. This process can include creating interaction terms or deriving new variables from existing ones.

- **Model Selection**: Multiple models were trained and evaluated to identify the best performer for this classification task. The model ultimately chosen was LightGBM, a gradient boosting framework known for its efficiency and accuracy.

- **Feature Selection**: RFECV (Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation) was applied to reduce the number of features from 70 to 50. This feature selection technique helps identify the most relevant features while improving model performance.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: RandomizedSearchCV was utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected model. This process involves searching through different combinations of hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.

The above steps led to positive results on both the validation and test sets, indicating the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data. Furthermore, the feature importance analysis using eli5 provided valuable insights into the key drivers of cancellations in the dataset. Notably, the `lead_time` and `average_price_per_room` features emerged as the most important, reflecting the customer's flexibility and price sensitivity, respectively.

## Further Improvements and Ideas
While achieving good results, there are additional avenues to explore for further improvement and interpretability:

- **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Experiment with more sophisticated feature engineering techniques, such as creating interaction terms or using embeddings to represent categorical variables. These methods may capture complex relationships and improve the model's predictive power.

- **Model Exploration**: Explore other types of models or ensembles, such as CatBoost and XGBoost, to evaluate whether they can enhance performance further. These models might uncover additional patterns in the data and provide better predictions.

- **Model Interpretability**: Employ techniques like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) to generate local explanations for individual predictions. This approach can provide insights into how the model arrives at its decisions, improving the interpretability and trustworthiness of the model.

- **Ensemble Methods**: Explore the possibility of creating ensemble models by combining the predictions of multiple models. Ensemble methods, such as bagging or stacking, can often lead to improved performance and robustness by leveraging the strengths of different models.

- **Further Analysis**: Conduct in-depth analysis to uncover potential biases or data quality issues that may affect the model's accuracy. This analysis could involve exploring relationships between features, investigating outliers, or considering other relevant factors that impact hotel reservation cancellations.
